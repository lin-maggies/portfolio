              In this project, we used third party API's such as Stripe for
              payments, and Clicksend for SMS services. We used AWS to host our
              website on Amplify, and used Lambda and API gateway for our
              back-end environment. I also did the flow of setting up email
              services using AWS SES, including setting up the email templates
              in JSON as well.

              First time working in a development team with product owners and
              other senior developers, also first time to be in an agile/scrum
              project. This is when I first started to see what it is like to
              work on a real life project in the web development industry. Also
              the first time when a single page waitlist page I coded was
              actually live on the internet, and being used to collect valuable
              data for the company.

            The biggest lesson here is suddenly realising how hard UI designers'
            jobs are. Choosing colors and figuring out how to best present the
            website is definitely not as simple as it seems. But I also really
            enjoyed just playing around with this website, trying things out.
            This is the first time Iâ€™ve set up a contact me form, and the moment
            when it started working was just amazing.

            Learnt alot about testing api with Postman and writing code to
            incorporate token-based authentiaction. We were integrating a
            shopping cart to an existing Webflow grocery shop. I was building
            the part where, with a hard coded product and customer detail
            already in the code, to have the ability to populate the cart and
            proceed to checkout using Foxycart's APIs.
